# AI Training Data Requirements

## Purpose
This document outlines the functional and system requirements for an AI training data project. The focus is on ensuring categorized training inquiries, eliminating biases, and improving data quality for AI models. The document follows best practices in requirement analysis and task structuring.

## User Requirements

### Requirement 1: Categorized Training Data
**As an AI Developer, I want to categorize training data into distinct topics and subtopics so that I can improve the relevance and precision of AI model training.**

#### Assumptions & Validation
**Assumptions:**
- Well-categorized training data enhances model learning efficiency.
- Manual and automated classification methods can work together.

**Validation:**
1. Check if the categorization improves model performance over multiple training iterations.
2. Conduct expert review sessions to validate topic categorization accuracy.
3. Compare models trained with and without categorized data to measure impact.

#### Preliminary Tasks
1. Define categories and subcategories relevant to training data.
2. Implement an initial classification algorithm for automation.
3. Conduct manual review to refine categorization accuracy.
4. Test model performance with categorized vs. non-categorized data.

#### Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow automatic categorization of training data.
2. The system should allow manual override for reclassification.
3. The system should maintain a categorized dataset repository.
4. The system should provide an analytics dashboard for evaluating categorization effectiveness.
