## AI Training Data Requirements

### Purpose
This document outlines key requirements for an AI training data project, focusing on categorized inquiries, bias elimination, and data quality improvement.

### User Requirements

#### 1. Categorized Training Data
**AI training data should be categorized into topics to improve model precision.**

- **Assumptions:** Categorization enhances model learning efficiency.
- **Validation:** Compare model performance with categorized vs. non-categorized data.
- **Tasks:** Define categories, implement classification, conduct manual review.
- **Functional:** Automate categorization, allow manual override, maintain dataset repository.
- **System:** Scalable storage, API support, integration with AI pipelines.

#### 2. Bias Detection & Mitigation
**Automated bias detection ensures fairness in AI models.**

- **Assumptions:** Training data may contain biases.
- **Validation:** Analyze datasets, compare flagged biases with human review.
- **Tasks:** Identify bias patterns, implement detection, review flagged data.
- **Functional:** Scan data for biases, allow corrections, provide impact reports.
- **System:** Scalable processing, historical bias reports, role-based access.

#### 3. Automated Data Cleaning
**Preprocessing ensures efficient AI model training.**

- **Assumptions:** Raw data contains inconsistencies and errors.
- **Validation:** Compare AI performance before and after cleaning.
- **Tasks:** Identify data issues, implement cleaning scripts, integrate into pipeline.
- **Functional:** Auto-correct inconsistencies, log cleaning actions, allow manual override.
- **System:** Scalable storage, batch processing, audit logs.

#### 4. Explainable AI Predictions
**Users should understand AI decisions through an explainability module.**

- **Assumptions:** Interpretability aids debugging and trust.
- **Validation:** Compare model accuracy with and without explainability features.
- **Tasks:** Implement explainability framework, develop prototype, test usability.
- **Functional:** Generate explanations, provide multiple formats, offer exploration tools.
- **System:** Scalable computation, exportable explanations, role-based access.

### Conclusion
These requirements ensure structured training data, bias mitigation, automated cleaning, and model interpretability for AI development.
